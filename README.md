# lemonadestand
C# console application that works on the basics of the language as well as SOLID design principles. 
SOLID Principles:
	I. Single Responsiblity Principle
		-The GetTemp and GetOvercast methods both randomly get the temperature and overcast. Both of these methods are doing one thing and they do it well. 
	II. Liskov Substitution Principle
		-The Lemon, Sugar, Ice, and Cup classes inherit off of the Supply class. The parent and child classes can be flipped and would still work.
